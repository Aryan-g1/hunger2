        <p class="all-text">In politics, humanitarian aid, and the social sciences, hunger is defined as a condition in which a person cannot eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs for a sustained period. In the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.


            The Hunger March in Copenhagen (dk)
            Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2014, the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's population. According to the FAO's 2020 The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report however, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has increased over the prior six years. This is both a percentage of the world's population and in absolute terms, with about 688 million afflicted with hunger in 2019.
            
            While most of the world's people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America. The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rising rates to be especially severe in countries where agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme weather variations. The FAO's 2019 report found a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown. The 2020 report looked at the prospects of achieving the hunger related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). It warned that if nothing is done to counter the adverse trends of the past six year, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger is on track to rise by over 150 millions by 2030.</p>
